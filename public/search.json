Create. Compete. Celebrate. JEC is an integral part of its host city of Jaipur, a diverse and vibrant community noted for its intellectual life, history, and thriving innovation climate. With a campus nestled in Aravali Hills in Kukas Jaipur, and near to glorious world heritage \"THE AMER FORT\", the Institute is optimally positioned to collaborate with its neighbors and to contribute to its community. Innovate. Create. Compete. Celebrate!!! At JEC, we welcome and support a diverse community of remarkable talent. But we know that to make a better world, we must work to continually make a better JEC. With that inspiration, we strive to remove barriers to talent wherever we find them, to build mutual understanding across our campus, to celebrate our wonderful range of cultures and backgrounds — and to help everyone in our community feel at home at JEC. Engineering & Society As we know that engineering affects virtually every aspect of our society and engages a substantial set of the population in carrying out engineers' plans and designs. But what is the nature of that activity? What is the role of engineering in responding to society's needs as well as in shaping them? How well does engineering carry out that role? These questions are being asked with increasing urgency by a society that has benefited from great advances in technology, and at the same time, seen dislocations and experienced fears associated with technology—a society that has become increasingly dependent on technology, but also increasingly ambivalent about it. Often the questions about technology are confused with questions about engineering in the mind of the public despite a growing literature on the relation of technology to the rest of society. In recent years several symposia by the National Academy of Engineering and other engineering organizations, as well as various reports and articles have addressed aspects of this relationship. “Cultural engineering is a conceptual approach to cultural development planning and management that takes into account the changing concepts of culture and the design of practical strategies for dealing with issues and problems raised by culture and development in diverse contexts…. In other words, cultural engineering is about systems, processes, alternatives and the formulation of creative solutions to challenges in the development of cultural institutions and the promotion of people’s participation in cultural life”. These cultural life at Engineering are more often called E-Fests or Engineering Festivals” E-Fests, or engineering festivals, are WAY more than just a series of events. It’s a movement driven by engineering students that has gained force globally. These year-round programs empower engineering students like YOU to ignite innovation, build your resume, expand your knowledge, participate in stimulating competitions, jump start your career and most importantly, celebrate engineering! Heritage Celebrating Values Like all professionals, engineers must possess a well-developed ability to synthesize issues and communicate effectively to diverse audiences. These E-Fests are designed to emphasize the value of an ability to deliver clear, concise and effective oral presentations, particularly pertaining to some sphere in which an engineer is or should be involved. If engineers are to play a more decisive and enlightened social role, the engineering community must be willing to act in line of the culture and rituals too on a number of issues. To fulfill this social vacuum within the budding engineers JEC has taken a step forward to celebrate festivals of diverse cultures and society. In this line the JEC family is proud to say that the social & cultural festivals like Buddha Poornima, Vivekanand Jayanti, Durga Puja, Holi, Depawali, Arya Samaj activities etc are celebrated with much fanfare in JEC Campus every year as deeper understanding of the consumer and cultural experience are key to making exceptional things. The briefs of selected few E-Fest activities organized year after year are given below Swami Vivekananda Jayanti We try to follow his saying \"Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true.” Swami Keshvanand Jayanti To adorn the ideals of Swami Keshvanand's deep understanding of the rural society every year JEC celebrates Swami Keshvanand Jayanti. The teachings of the desert region can be gleaned from his book \"Maru Bhumi Seva Karya\". In this book, he has explained the peculiarities of the Desert region, identified the problems and suggested solutions. It was Swami Keshvanand's lifelong endeavour to eradicate social evils like untouchability, illiteracy, child marriage, indebtedness, poverty, backwardness, alcohol abuse, moral dissipation, etc. Swami Keshvanand, born in a Jat Hindu family of Dhaka clan, and a renunciate belonging to the Udasi sect which was propagated by Srichandji, son of guru Nanakdevji, the founder of the Sikh faith, was a unique example of communal harmony. He organised celebrations in honour of Sikh, Bishnoi, Namdhari and Jain gurus. During the partition of India in 1947, he looked after wounded Muslims admitted to hospitals and arranged food and shelter for them. To be true engineering professionals his teachings of equality ought to be inherited by engineers. Arya Samaj The havan can be performed with a priest for special occassions or without a priest for personal worship. The havan is performed as per the havan pustika, usually a simplified guide to do havan, having mantras for general or special occasions. The priest is generally a Vedic scholar from the local Arya Samaj Mandir or Gurukul. Sometimes elder members of family or neighbours can also perform the havan acting as a purohit. The host is known as the 'Yajmana'. The priest can be called an 'Acharya', 'Swami ji' or 'Pandit Ji' depending upon his scholar status and local reputation. It is customary to give a nominal 'dakshina' to the priest after havan, although in Arya Samaj it is more symbolic and the priest doesn't state any sum. The Diya with four wicks of Arya Samaj points in each direction represent N-North, W-West, S- South and E-East. This has some kind of resemblance with Vastu-Shastra and Engineering.

This demand for technical talent is certainly great news for anyone entering the engineering profession. But to paraphrase the old business institute saying, “with success comes increased competition.” And you can be sure the best jobs go to the best prepared. \"You may have heard that engineering is a man’s world... Wait a second, though! Is it really all about nuts and bolts, spanners and screwdrivers? Definitely not.\" Furthermore, you may have heard that the world of engineering is full of men who have all the technical skills in the world, but no social skills to match. In many people’s minds, an engineering career is a constant love affair between a man and his machines. And do women actually work in engineering? Of course they do! Now the time has changed and women are equally superior in all respect. Forget anything you’ve heard previously! Before you make the decision to get into engineering, you should firstly discover what it’s really all about. Engineers are all about solving problems using specialist technical and practical skills. It’s all about maths, science, research, prototypes, design, maintenance and production. Every industry and every area of society depends on the precise and efficient work of engineers. The engineers provide technological solutions to the problems, issues and ideas that affect every area of our lives. They design, manufacture and maintain almost everything people and industries use, from computers, spacecraft and boats to corkscrews, buildings and chemical reactors. Technological advances would never happen without engineers. Consequently, the people who work in this sector are massively important in developing the future of our society. Hall of Fame Strategies for Success Rupshri Priya Electronics & Communication Engineering Engineering College, as a discipline, ECE focuses on the design of underlying hardware systems. The curriculum is directed to applications in major areas such as telecommunications, energy and electronics sectors, while encouraging development of necessary skills for integration of hardware and software components. She believes that many creative opportunities exist at the boundaries of ECE, and she had accordingly planned for cross-training of students across disciplinary boundaries. Her Success Plan: Strengthen your physics and math fundamentals Learn how to read data sheets, circuits and devices Find out how to learn, unlearn and relearn. Discover how to design circuit boards using some good software and have them physically made and test them Buy a DMM and soldering iron, and USE them Learn C / C++, Python and Artificial Intelligence Start using Linux, IRC and get involved in hardware open source projects like fabathome.org, gnuradio.org Build your own capacitor, resistor, antenna or any other electrical components using paper, clips and other locally available material Hitendra Malviya His Strategy to RAS: During B Tech candidate can start their preparation for RAS Aptitude and Reasoning covers almost 20 percent of the syllabus. Buy some good and authenticate notes for study. Must go throughout with NCERT Books at least once from VIII onwards classes. Quality books must always be referred, as they offer depth and clarity which is the hallmark of cracking RAS. Solving previous 20 years papers of RAS and IAS can be very helpful. Suresh Kumar Choudhary His Strategy to Qualify GATE: II yr B Tech is the right time to start the preparation for the GATE as the curriculum of second year covers 40 percent of the syllabus. III yr B Tech covers almost 50 percent of the syllabus. Quality books must always be referred, as they offer depth and clarity which is the hallmark of cracking GATE. Solving previous 20 years papers of GATE, IES & PSU can be very helpful. Making monthly, weekly and daily plans is a good habit! Urooz Khanam Urooz Khanam, a 2018 pass out Mechanical Engineering student of Jaipur Engineering College, loves to work in challenging environments. She opted mechanical engineer in order to be quality engineer in MNC. But later on the advice of his father, she choose to work in a committed organization for developing educational support materials. Her Mantras of Success: Be strong in mathematics and science Make yourself highly analytical and detail-oriented Be sure to imaginative and creative Develop good communication skills Enjoy working in teams Get pleasure from building or improving the way things work. Sunil Sharma Is hard core programming done by urban students only? If you think the answer is yes, think it over again. Sunil Sharma, a boy from a farmer family in rural India, became the Highest Paid Engineering Graduate of 2012 batch in Rajasthan! Sunil graduated in 2012 from JEC Group in Computer Engineering. He did his schooling from an obscure village Dehlal in Lalsot Tehsil of Dausa, Rajasthan. He was in 11th class, when he came across the word 'Engineer' for the first time! An year later, while filling the form for AIEEE, he saw computer in a local cyber cafe and got fascinated. Here was an engineering student who had used the computer for the very first time in First Semester... Internet for the first time in Second Semester. Yet he refused to give in. He pursued studies single-mindedly and became one of the most regular students of his college. He used to attend all the classes and listen to faculty members with rapt attention and respect. The guidance he got by being humble and courteous to teachers, helped him to cross the threshold of knowledge in few years. He mastered JAVA and Oracle and honed programming skills through taking up variety of projects. He excelled not only in academics but also created a website that offers customized IT solutions to clients spread across continents. When he was in second year, he started utilizing the huge potential of LinkedIn. He made large number of contacts through it and started sending his CV to top notch people of IT industry. By now he had a rich experience of making software for national and international clients. Noticing the spark in him, he was recommended to Tony and Joe's Seafood Place. Although this job opportunity was not for fresher graduates, yet Sunil got shortlisted for the technical round. His competitors were experienced professionals across the world and yet, an unlettered farmer's son surpassed them all, bagging first position internationally! He was offered a whooping monthly salary of 10270 USD in Tony and Joe's Sea Food Place, Washington DC. Currently Playing Lead Roles In: Hawks Code Softwares Pvt. Ltd.

HawksCool - ERP InstallerManiya - India's Best Installer Development Company MusicManiya.com - Listen Free Live FM worldwide & Free songs TCAIM: Shailesh Jha Shailesh Jha, Batch 2008-2012 Electrical Engineering presently employed in TATA MOTORS, explains that for becoming an electrical engineer requires training, commitment, and the willingness to wonder about questions such as how a flat screen television manages to be energy efficient or how a Las Vegas casino manages to use so much electricity without blowing a fuse. Electrical engineers answer the tough electrical questions and may work on anything from handheld gadgets to massive electrical grids. In getting there, electrical engineers must consider questions such as: What level of degree should I get to maximize my income? What concentration should I learn to obtain my dream career? Do I have to join an engineering firm or can I work on my own? To Succeed as a Best Electrical Engineer: Use mathematical concepts to solve problems Understand how transmission lines carry alternate current Install and maintain power control equipment, motors and other electrical devices used in manufacturing plants and power plants Learn analyzing and designing complex electrical devices, software, and systems Communicate with other industries and business professionals effectively Harshita Bhat Harshita Bhat, 2009-2013 Batch CSE student of Jaipur Engineering College, advises that whether you enrolled for a Bachelor’s or a Master’s degree in Computer Science, you want to be a top student and prove you constantly advance your computing skills. Regardless of your specialization, Computer Science degrees are challenging, even if you are a super tech fanatic and passionate. So how do you deal and work with a significant amount of new information you learn every day matters a lot. Five Basic Tricks: Focus on practical skills Studying the night before a deadline will NOT work You could also make little websites or programs just for yourself, to test your abilities and push yourself further. Team work takes some skills you’ll need to brush up on and work constantly. Don’t forget that you’re not alone, and its’ highly unlikely you’ll be alone in the workplace as well. You’re likely to be part of a team. Your studies are critical, but they shouldn’t be the only thing in your life. Going out and having fun will refresh your mind and increase your grades. Relax, have fun, and good luck!"
